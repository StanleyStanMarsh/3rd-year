Tsiolkovsky was born in Izhevskoye (now in Spassky District, Ryazan Oblast), in the Russian Empire, to a middle\PYGZhy{}class family. His father was a Polish forester of Roman Catholic faith who relocated to Russia; his Russian Orthodox mother Maria Ivanovna Yumasheva was of mixed Volga Tatar and Russian origin. His father was successively a forester, teacher, and minor government official. At the age of 9, Konstantin caught scarlet fever and lost his hearing. When he was 13, his mother died. He was not admitted to elementary schools because of his hearing problem, so he was self\PYGZhy{}taught. As a reclusive home\PYGZhy{}schooled child, he passed much of his time by reading books and became interested in mathematics and physics. As a teenager, he began to contemplate the possibility of space travel. Tsiolkovsky spent three years attending a Moscow library, where Russian cosmism proponent Nikolai Fyodorov worked. He later came to believe that colonizing space would lead to the perfection of the human species, with immortality and a carefree existence. Additionally, inspired by the fiction of Jules Verne, Tsiolkovsky theorized many aspects of space travel and rocket propulsion. He is considered the father of spaceflight and the first person to conceive the space elevator, becoming inspired in 1895 by the newly constructed Eiffel Tower in Paris.
Despite the youth\PYGZsq{}s growing knowledge of physics, his father was concerned that he would not be able to provide for himself financially as an adult and brought him back home at the age of 19 after learning that he was overworking himself and going hungry. Afterwards, Tsiolkovsky passed the teacher\PYGZsq{}s exam and went to work at a school in Borovsk near Moscow. He also met and married his wife Varvara Sokolova during this time. Despite being stuck in Kaluga, a small town far from major learning centers, Tsiolkovsky managed to make scientific discoveries on his own.
The first two decades of the 20th century were marred by personal tragedy. Tsiolkovsky\PYGZsq{}s son Ignaty committed suicide in 1902, and in 1908 many of his accumulated papers were lost in a flood. In 1911, his daughter Lyubov was arrested for engaging in revolutionary activities.
Tsiolkovsky stated that he developed the theory of rocketry only as a supplement to philosophical research on the subject. He wrote more than 400 works including approximately 90 published pieces on space travel and related subjects. Among his works are designs for rockets with steering thrusters, multistage boosters, space stations, airlocks for exiting a spaceship into the vacuum of space, and closed\PYGZhy{}cycle biological systems to provide food and oxygen for space colonies.
Tsiolkovsky\PYGZsq{}s first scientific study dates back to 1880–1881. He wrote a paper called \PYGZdq{}Theory of Gases,\PYGZdq{} in which he outlined the basis of the kinetic theory of gases, but after submitting it to the Russian Physico\PYGZhy{}Chemical Society, he was informed that his discoveries had already been made 25 years earlier. Undaunted, he pressed ahead with his second work, \PYGZdq{}The Mechanics of the Animal Organism\PYGZdq{}. It received favorable feedback, and Tsiolkovsky was made a member of the Society. Tsiolkovsky\PYGZsq{}s main works after 1884 dealt with four major areas: the scientific rationale for the all\PYGZhy{}metal balloon, streamlined airplanes and trains, hovercraft, and rockets for interplanetary travel.
In 1892, he was transferred to a new teaching post in Kaluga where he continued to experiment. During this period, Tsiolkovsky began working on a problem that would occupy much of his time during the coming years: an attempt to build an all\PYGZhy{}metal dirigible that could be expanded or shrunk in size.
Tsiolkovsky developed the first aerodynamics laboratory in Russia in his apartment. In 1897, he built the first Russian wind tunnel with an open test section and developed a method of experimentation using it. In 1900, with a grant from the Academy of Sciences, he made a survey using models of the simplest shapes and determined the drag coefficients of the sphere, flat plates, cylinders, cones, and other bodies. Tsiolkovsky\PYGZsq{}s work in the field of aerodynamics was a source of ideas for Russian scientist Nikolay Zhukovsky, the father of modern aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. Tsiolkovsky described the airflow around bodies of different geometric shapes, but because the Society did not provide any financial support for this project, he was forced to pay for it largely out of his own pocket.
Tsiolkovsky studied the mechanics of lighter\PYGZhy{}than\PYGZhy{}air powered flying machines. He first proposed the idea of an all\PYGZhy{}metal dirigible and built a model of it. The first printed work on the airship was \PYGZdq{}A Controllable Metallic Balloon\PYGZdq{} in which he gave the scientific and technical rationale for the design of an airship with a metal sheath. Tsiolkovsky was not supported on the airship project, and the author was refused a grant to build the model. An appeal to the General Aviation Staff of the Russian army also had no success. In 1892, he turned to the new and unexplored field of heavier\PYGZhy{}than\PYGZhy{}air aircraft. Tsiolkovsky\PYGZsq{}s idea was to build an airplane with a metal frame. In the article \PYGZdq{}An Airplane or a Birdlike Flying Machine\PYGZdq{} are descriptions and drawings of a monoplane, which in its appearance and aerodynamics anticipated the design of aircraft that would be constructed 15 to 18 years later. In an Aviation Airplane, the wings have a thick profile with a rounded front edge and the fuselage is faired. But work on the airplane, as well as on the airship, did not receive recognition from the official representatives of Russian science, and Tsiolkovsky\PYGZsq{}s further research had neither monetary nor moral support. In 1914, he displayed his models of all\PYGZhy{}metal dirigibles at the Aeronautics Congress in St. Petersburg but met with a lukewarm response.
Disappointed at this, Tsiolkovsky gave up on space and aeronautical problems with the onset of World War I and instead turned his attention to the problem of alleviating poverty. This occupied his time during the war years until the Russian Revolution in 1917.
Starting in 1896, Tsiolkovsky systematically studied the theory of motion of rocket apparatus. Thoughts on the use of the rocket principle in the cosmos were expressed by him as early as 1883, and a rigorous theory of rocket propulsion was developed in 1896. Tsiolkovsky derived the formula, which he called the \PYGZdq{}formula of aviation\PYGZdq{}, now known as Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, establishing the relationship between change in the rocket\PYGZsq{}s speed exhaust velocity of the engine initial and final mass of the rocket. After writing out this equation, Tsiolkovsky recorded the date: 10 May 1897. In the same year, the formula for the motion of a body of variable mass was published in the thesis of the Russian mathematician I V Meshchersky.
His most important work, published in May 1903, was Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices. Tsiolkovsky calculated, using the Tsiolkovsky equation, that the horizontal speed required for a minimal orbit around the Earth is 8000 meters per second and that this could be achieved by means of a multistage rocket fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. In the article Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices it was suggested for the first time that a rocket could perform space flight. In this article and its sequels he developed some ideas of missiles and considered the use of liquid rocket engines.
The outward appearance of Tsiolkovsky\PYGZsq{}s spacecraft design, published in 1903, was a basis for modern spaceship design. The design had a hull divided into three main sections. The pilot and copilot would occupy the first section, while the second and third sections held the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen needed to fuel the spacecraft.
